Barebones CMS - Flash Object (SWF) shortcode
============================================

Adds a new Shortcode to the content editor that makes it easy to embed Flash objects (SWF).

This is a very general-purpose Shortcode and can insert screencasts, advertisements, videos, and anything else that is pure Flash content.  To mix Flash and Javascript, combine this Shortcode with the Code widget.

Leverages the third-party library SWFObject (ver 2.2).  (http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/)
